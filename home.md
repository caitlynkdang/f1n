# Dear Matthew,

Happy belated Valentine‚Äôs Day! 

Some things never change. You are *still* **so easy** to love. üíò

Because I couldn‚Äôt find a worthy enough Valentine‚Äôs Day card, I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôll continue the tradition of writing my love letters to you on the internet.

I can‚Äôt even begin to think of all the things we‚Äôve experienced since last Valentine‚Äôs! To list a few:

- Covid quarantine in FL/UT
- Visiting your family for the first time in Utah and meeting everyone!
- Adventures in Maine, sailing for the first time
- Adventures in Utah (Cottonwood Wash & Arches National Park)
- Cross Country Road trip (FL to SEA) !!! 
- Adventures in Maine Pt. 2 with friends!
- Thanksgiving at the Dang‚Äôs (Catan 24/7)
- New Year‚Äôs at the Finlayson‚Äôs (dance party)
- Skiing in Park City
- Seattle! 

In one year, our strength and love has grown so much! We‚Äôve been challenged and have pushed each other to be better partners and friends. There is no one else I‚Äôd rather experience my highs and lows with. I chose you every day.

Thank you for being my rock this past year. I‚Äôve never felt so confident in knowing who I want to grow old with. I love you! 

Love,

Caitlyn

# Dear Matthew,

I hope no one else finds this in the very nonsecure world of the internet. Oh well, they have our names, addresses, and your DNA sequence already. Your last name won't appear anywhere, but who knows, machines are smart!

Happy Valentine's Day üíå! Another excuse to smother you with squishes and kisses. I hope you don't mind; I can't help myself. I mean, look at you!

So, I thought this would be the perfect time to confess my love for you. Every time I try to tell you how much I love you and why I love you, I end up just telling you you're cute.

Well, üçØ, you are cute. But there's also a bajillion more reasons why I love you:

```
\begin{enumerate}
  \item I love you when you're clean on Sunday mornings and gross and dandruff-y on non-Sunday mornings. 
  
  \item I love that we're silly together. It brings me SO much joy!
  
  \item I love how you look when you're sleeping. So soft and cuddly and cute and lovable.
  
  \item I love how much you love your family. It's telling of how much you'll love your own family and it makes me feel warm. Watching you love your family makes me want to be a better sister and daughter.
  
  \item I love your fantastic sense of style and eye for quality things. Someone gets me! It was love at first sight when I saw your clean laptop screen. I knew you were the one. 
  
  \item I love that you care. About doing the right thing, being a good person, friend, and partner. 
  
  \item I love your expressions of disbelief! I will still love you even if you're almost 200 pounds. "More to love!" - You
  
  \item I love the late night talks where we about everything in world. I feel like I can share all my thoughts with you and be myself.
  
  \item I love your commitment to your religion. I'm still figuring out why I love this so much. Here's what I know so far: it tells me a lot about your values and your commitment to being the best version of yourself. It shows me your commitment to your family and friends and even to the strangers around you. It's beautiful!
  
  \item I love that you're curious. The sparkle in your eye when you talk about math, NLP, outer space, animals, and dinosaurs \cdots
  
  \item I love your concentrated face when you're writing in your Moleskine. You place the end of your quality pencil on your lip and think. hehe SO CUTE!
  
  \item Naps with you are INCREDIBLE.
  
  \item I love seeing you and Ellie together. She loves you! It makes me so happy. You passed the test with flying colors.
    
  \item I love all of you.
  
  \item Be with me forever?
\end{enumerate}
```

You're easy to love. Your adorable smile and lovely green eyes and cute mustache and soft tummy.

I loved introducing you to my family and showing you off to everyone I know back home. I want to scream "I found the *one*!". You make me happy and excited about the future. I want to travel the world with you , go to random and awesome and crazy places with you. I want to hike more glaciers and sleep in more tents with you. I want to wake up with the sun shining on your face so I can get a better glimpse of the boy that brings me so much happiness. I want to talk about machine learning and neural networks, about heavy metal pencils and the perfect paper, about math and proofs, about kids and life and religion. I can talk to you forever!

Anyway, if I continue, I might end up writing a book. I'll save the rest of the love for in person. ü•∞

Love,

Yours

P.S. I have this domain for a year. The use of the website is TBD. But it's the best $12 I've ever spent! I might just use this to write more love letters to you.
